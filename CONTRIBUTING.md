### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the project? You can start by looking through these `Good First Issue` and
`Help Wanted` issues:

- Good First Issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help Wanted Issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than Good First Issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for project maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. The configured threshold must be respected.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Style Guide

Ensure the quality before opening your pull request. You will find all the necessary commands in the `package.json` file
or you can run the git hooks manually to check your code.

### Git Commit Messages

1. Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
2. Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
3. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
4. Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
5. The maintainers of this repository uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/). This is not mandatory.

### Merging Policy

We require that all contributions show a linear history. This means no merge commits in your pull requests. Rebase your
feature branch onto the main branch and resolve any conflicts. If you are unsure about how to do this,
[Atlassian has a great tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).
